## .stl or .svg files for your Jack â€” if you use some other technique, include the respective supporting material.

I created a "Doraemon" by onshape. First, draw a sketch from the top plane. Then extend the sketch to form a 3-D model. Finally use the extracted 3-D model to print using AI with laser-cut.
